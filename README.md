New-World-Framework
===================
A game programming framework written in the D programming language.

Background:
==========
This is a -proposal- for a game programming framework. It is meant to provide the basic structure for a game, but not the mechanics. My hope is that this will be useful for both new and adept game developers. 

Goals:
=====
* Provide an architectural foundation for new game programmers.
* Easy to grasp.

TODOs:
=====
* Add example code.
* Add diagrams.
* 2dGraphicService.
* Audio.
